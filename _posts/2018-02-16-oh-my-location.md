I am going to develop a Location Based Service. This give a service which share current location within users. So someone uses this for checking one's children or checking friends locations. I don't think something special. Just only sharing locations. The usages will be found by users. For this reason, we have to provide easy way to join our service. 

# Login
So we give 3 ways to join this service.

1. Faceboock login.
2. Kakaotalk login.
3. Google login.

And in someday, i provide authentications by email or phone.

Now, think about services. This is location sharing service for many reasons. The most important usage of them is concorns for precious people. So i will give a range alert.

# Range Alert
This means an alert for some area. Users set some areas and a precious person and an option whether to come or leave. It is the most important thing that users don't feel like they're being stalked but feel they're in safe. So Taking someone's locations must be allowed by the person. And always users can check who is got their location.

1. Who want to be notified someone's locations must be allowed to revice location from the person.
2. Users who is allowed to notified can check where is that person. And can see where that person was in.
3. They also can be notified an alarm when someone who allow to notify there location come in/out specific area.

* A user who allow to notify his location can see how many one is watching his location in system notification.

# Screenshots
This is some wireframes.

Users will be saw this page at the first time.(Login)

And users can found family, friends or lover.
